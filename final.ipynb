And the results showed as below.\n1)\tAccording to road conditions.\n\n \nDry condition showed the most percentage 65.7% of accidents. The second was wet condition with 25.1% and the third was Unknown 8.3% and the rest was showing a small percentage. \n\n2)\tAccording to Weather conditions.\n\n \nClear condition showed the most percentage 58.6% of accidents. The second was Raining condition with 17.5% and the third was Overcast 14.6% and the fourth was Unknown rating 8.0% and rest was showing a small percentage. \n\nDiscussion\nAs we can see, Raining and wet condition each rated 2nd place in the data frame. Which we can interpret this to think that wetness of the ground had influences on the probability of accidents. But we can\u2019t conclude that it causes the most affect. Since, dry and clear sky was the most percentage in the result. So we can say the cause of accident according to the weather isn\u2019t that big. \nConclusion\nThe weather condition did not give that much of an influence as much as I expected. However, in the aftermath I believe if we compare other city\u2019s data we could see if it causes more or less influences. \nI believe there are more conditions we can try out and see the relationship between the accident."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.6", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.6.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
